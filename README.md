## About

The PyMongo distribution contains tools for interacting with MongoDB
database from Python. The `bson` package is an implementation of the
[BSON format](http://bsonspec.org) for Python. The `pymongo` package is
a native Python driver for MongoDB, offering both synchronous and asynchronous APIs. The `gridfs` package is a
[gridfs](https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/gridfs/gridfs-spec.md/)
implementation on top of `pymongo`.

PyMongo supports MongoDB 4.0, 4.2, 4.4, 5.0, 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0. PyMongo follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) for its releases.

## Documentation

Documentation is available at
[mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/languages/python/pymongo-driver/current/).

[API documentation](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/) and the [full changelog](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html) for each release is available at [readthedocs.io](https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html).

## Support / Feedback

For issues with, questions about, or feedback for PyMongo, please look
into our [support channels](https://support.mongodb.com/welcome). Please
do not email any of the PyMongo developers directly with issues or
questions - you're more likely to get an answer on
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mongodb)
(using a "mongodb" tag).

## Bugs / Feature Requests

Think you've found a bug? Want to see a new feature in PyMongo? Please
open a case in our issue management tool, JIRA:

-   [Create an account and login](https://jira.mongodb.org).
-   Navigate to [the PYTHON
    project](https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON).
-   Click **Create Issue** - Please provide as much information as
    possible about the issue type and how to reproduce it.

Bug reports in JIRA for all driver projects (i.e. PYTHON, CSHARP, JAVA)
and the Core Server (i.e. SERVER) project are **public**.

### How To Ask For Help

Please include all of the following information when opening an issue:

-   Detailed steps to reproduce the problem, including full traceback,
    if possible.

-   The exact python version used, with patch level:

```bash
python -c "import sys; print(sys.version)"
```

-   The exact version of PyMongo used, with patch level:

```bash
python -c "import pymongo; print(pymongo.version); print(pymongo.has_c())"
```

-   The operating system and version (e.g. Windows 7, OSX 10.8, ...)

-   Web framework or asynchronous network library used, if any, with
    version (e.g. Django 1.7, mod_wsgi 4.3.0, gevent 1.0.1, Tornado
    4.0.2, ...)

### Security Vulnerabilities

If you've identified a security vulnerability in a driver or any other
MongoDB project, please report it according to the [instructions
here](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/create-a-vulnerability-report/).

## Installation

PyMongo can be installed with [pip](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip):

```bash
python -m pip install pymongo
```

You can also download the project source and do:

```bash
pip install .
```

Do **not** install the "bson" package from pypi. PyMongo comes with
its own bson package; running "pip install bson" installs a third-party
package that is incompatible with PyMongo.

## Dependencies

PyMongo supports CPython 3.9+ and PyPy3.9+.

Required dependencies:

Support for `mongodb+srv://` URIs requires [dnspython](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dnspython)

Optional dependencies:

GSSAPI authentication requires
[pykerberos](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pykerberos) on Unix or
[WinKerberos](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/winkerberos) on Windows. The
correct dependency can be installed automatically along with PyMongo:

```bash
python -m pip install "pymongo[gssapi]"
```

MONGODB-AWS authentication requires
[pymongo-auth-aws](https://pypi.org/project/pymongo-auth-aws/):

```bash
python -m pip install "pymongo[aws]"
```

OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol) requires
[PyOpenSSL](https://pypi.org/project/pyOpenSSL/),
[requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/),
[service_identity](https://pypi.org/project/service_identity/) and may
require [certifi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/certifi):

```bash
python -m pip install "pymongo[ocsp]"
```

Wire protocol compression with snappy requires
[python-snappy](https://pypi.org/project/python-snappy):

```bash
python -m pip install "pymongo[snappy]"
```

Wire protocol compression with zstandard requires
[backports.zstd](https://pypi.org/project/backports.zstd)
when used with Python versions before 3.14:

```bash
python -m pip install "pymongo[zstd]"
```

Client-Side Field Level Encryption requires
[pymongocrypt](https://pypi.org/project/pymongocrypt/) and
[pymongo-auth-aws](https://pypi.org/project/pymongo-auth-aws/):

```bash
python -m pip install "pymongo[encryption]"
```
You can install all dependencies automatically with the following
command:

```bash
python -m pip install "pymongo[gssapi,aws,ocsp,snappy,zstd,encryption]"
```

## Examples

Here's a basic example (for more see the *examples* section of the
docs):

```pycon
>>> import pymongo
>>> client = pymongo.MongoClient("localhost", 27017)
>>> db = client.test
>>> db.name
'test'
>>> db.my_collection
Collection(Database(MongoClient('localhost', 27017), 'test'), 'my_collection')
>>> db.my_collection.insert_one({"x": 10}).inserted_id
ObjectId('4aba15ebe23f6b53b0000000')
>>> db.my_collection.insert_one({"x": 8}).inserted_id
ObjectId('4aba160ee23f6b543e000000')
>>> db.my_collection.insert_one({"x": 11}).inserted_id
ObjectId('4aba160ee23f6b543e000002')
>>> db.my_collection.find_one()
{'x': 10, '_id': ObjectId('4aba15ebe23f6b53b0000000')}
>>> for item in db.my_collection.find():
...     print(item["x"])
...
10
8
11
>>> db.my_collection.create_index("x")
'x_1'
>>> for item in db.my_collection.find().sort("x", pymongo.ASCENDING):
...     print(item["x"])
...
8
10
11
>>> [item["x"] for item in db.my_collection.find().limit(2).skip(1)]
[8, 11]
```
