Some notes on PyMongo releases
==============================

Versioning
----------

We shoot for a release every month or so - that will generally just
increment the middle version number (e.g. 1.6.1 -> 1.7). We're
getting to the point where a 2.0 release would be reasonable, though -
a lot has changed since 1.0.

Minor releases are reserved for bug fixes (in general no new features
or deprecations) - they only happen in cases where there is a critical
bug in a recently released version, or when a release has no new
features or API changes.

In between releases we use a "+" version number to denote the version
under development. So if we just released 1.6, then the current dev
version would be 1.6+. When we make the next release (1.6.1 or 1.7) we
replace all instances of 1.6+ in the docs with the new version number.

Deprecation
-----------

Changes should be backwards compatible unless absolutely
necessary. When making API changes the approach is generally to add a
deprecation warning but keeping the existing API
functional. Eventually (after at least ~4 releases) we can remove the
old API.

Doing a Release
---------------

1. Test release on Python 2.4-2.7 on Windows, Linux and OSX, with and without the C extension. Generally enough to just run the tests on 2.4 and 2.7 with and without the extension on a single platform, and then just test any version on the other platforms as a sanity check. `python setup.py test` will build the extension and test. `python tools/clean.py` will remove the extension, and then `nosetests` will run the tests without it. Can also run the doctests: `python setup.py doc -t`. For building extensions on Windows check section below.

2. Add release notes to doc/changelog.rst. Generally just summarize/clarify the git log, but might add some more long form notes for big changes.

3. Search and replace the "+" version number w/ the new version number (see note above).

4. Make sure version number is updated in setup.py and pymongo/__init__.py

5. Commit with a BUMP version_number message.

6. Tag w/ version_number

7. Push commit / tag.

8. Push source to PyPI: `python setup.py sdist upload`

9. Push binaries to PyPI; for each version of python and platform do: `python setup.py bdist_egg upload`. Probably best to do `python setup.py bdist_egg` first, to make sure the egg builds properly. Notably on the Windows machine, for Python 2.4 and 2.5, you will have to run `python setup.py build -c mingw32 bdist_egg upload` or the C extension build will fail with an error about Visual Studio 2003. On Windows we also push a binary installer. The setup.py target for that is `bdist_wininst`.

10. Make sure the docs have properly updated (driver buildbot does this).

11. Add a "+" to the version number in setup.py/__init__.py, commit, push.

12. Announce!

Building extensions on Windows
------------------------------
Currently the default `python setup.py test` builds extensions on Windows 32 bit only. The default option requires Visual Studio (C++ Express) 2008 and works with Python 2.6 and 2.7. The tests can be run in Python 2.4 and 2.5 by installing MingW32 and running the appropriate command in step 3 below.

1. On your Windows 32 bit machine install Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition (or equivalent 2008 edition) in the default location. For Python 2.4 or 2.5 install MingW32 in it's default location.

2. Ensure you have nose installed.

3. Run `\path\to\Python2(6|7) setup.py test` or `\path\to\Python2(4|5) setup.py build -c mingw32 test` to build the C extensions and run pymongo tests.
