About
=====

This is a semi-official port of PyMongo 1.9+ to Python 3.x. Semantics are
mostly compatible with the official PyMongo branch, except for a few things
listed in the next section. This port can currently only be used on Python 3.1
or later. Compatibility with Python 2.6+ may be added in the future.

The PyMongo distribution contains tools for interacting with MongoDB
database from Python.  The ``bson`` package is an implementation of
the `BSON format <http://bsonspec.org>`_ for Python. The ``pymongo``
package is a native Python driver for MongoDB. The ``gridfs`` package
is a `gridfs
<http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/GridFS+Specification>`_
implementation on top of ``pymongo``.

About the Py3K port
===================

Byte strings and unicode strings were clearly separated in Python 3. PyMongo3
adapts to these changes by decoding Binary of subtype 0 to the "bytes" type.
There has been considerable effort to make things work the way developers would
expect them to, with regards to the new semantics of Python 3. If you feel
that the new semantics don't match your expectations, feel free to ask on the
mailing list or create a new issue on github (see the next section for that).

Issues / Questions / Feedback
=============================

Any issues with, questions about, or feedback for PyMongo3 should be
sent to the mongodb-user list on Google Groups. For confirmed issues
or feature requests, open a case on `github
<https://github.com/agronholm/mongo-python-driver-py3k/issues>`_.
Please do not e-mail any of the PyMongo developers directly with issues or
questions - you're more likely to get an answer on the list.

Installation
============

If you have `distribute
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute/>`_ installed you
should be able to do **easy_install pymongo** to install
PyMongo. Otherwise you can download the project source and do **python
setup.py install** to install.

Dependencies
============

The PyMongo3 distribution is supported and tested on Python 3.x, where
x >= 1.

Additional dependencies are:

- (to generate documentation) sphinx_
- (to auto-discover tests) `nose <http://bitbucket.org/caseman/nose3-caseman-fix/>`_

Examples
========
Here's a basic example (for more see the *examples* section of the docs):

>>> import pymongo
>>> connection = pymongo.Connection("localhost", 27017)
>>> db = connection.test
>>> db.name()
'test'
>>> db.my_collection
Collection(Database(Connection('localhost', 27017), 'test'), 'my_collection')
>>> db.my_collection.save({"x": 10})
ObjectId('4aba15ebe23f6b53b0000000')
>>> db.my_collection.save({"x": 8})
ObjectId('4aba160ee23f6b543e000000')
>>> db.my_collection.save({"x": 11})
ObjectId('4aba160ee23f6b543e000002')
>>> db.my_collection.find_one()
{'x': 10, '_id': ObjectId('4aba15ebe23f6b53b0000000')}
>>> for item in db.my_collection.find():
...     print item["x"]
...
10
8
11
>>> db.my_collection.create_index("x")
'x_1'
>>> for item in db.my_collection.find().sort("x", pymongo.ASCENDING):
...     print item["x"]
...
8
10
11
>>> [item["x"] for item in db.my_collection.find().limit(2).skip(1)]
[8, 11]

Documentation
=============

You will need sphinx_ installed to generate the
documentation. Documentation can be generated by running **python
setup.py doc**. Generated documentation can be found in the
*doc/build/html/* directory.

Testing
=======

The easiest way to run the tests is to install the Python 3.x compatible fork
of nosetests, `nose3
<http://bitbucket.org/caseman/nose3-caseman-fix/>`_ and run **nosetests3** or
**python setup.py test** in the root of the distribution.
Tests are located in the *test/* directory.
