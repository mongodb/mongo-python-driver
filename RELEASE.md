# Some notes on PyMongo releases

## Versioning

We follow [semver](https://semver.org/) and [pep-0440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440)
for versioning.

We shoot for a release every few months - that will generally just
increment the middle / minor version number (e.g. `3.5.0` -> `3.6.0`).

Patch releases are reserved for bug fixes (in general no new features or
deprecations) - they only happen in cases where there is a critical bug
in a recently released version, or when a release has no new features or
API changes.

In between releases we add `.devN` to the version number to denote the
version under development. So if we just released `3.6.0`, then the
current dev version might be `3.6.1.dev0` or `3.7.0.dev0`. When we make the
next release we replace all instances of `3.x.x.devN` in the docs with the
new version number.

## Deprecation

Changes should be backwards compatible unless absolutely necessary. When
making API changes the approach is generally to add a deprecation
warning but keeping the existing API functional. Deprecated features can
be removed in a release that changes the major version number.

## Doing a Release

1.  PyMongo is tested on Evergreen. Ensure the latest commit are passing
    [CI](https://spruce.mongodb.com/commits/mongo-python-driver) as expected.

2.  Check Jira to ensure all the tickets in this version have been
    completed.

3.  Add release notes to `doc/changelog.rst`. Generally just
    summarize/clarify the git log, but you might add some more long form
    notes for big changes.

4.  Make sure version number is updated in `pymongo/_version.py`

5.  Commit with a BUMP version_number message, eg
    `git commit -m 'BUMP 3.11.0'`.

6.  Tag w/ version_number, eg,
    `git tag -a '3.11.0' -m 'BUMP 3.11.0' <COMMIT>`.

7. Bump the version number to `<next version>.dev0` in
    `pymongo/_version.py`, commit, push.

8.  Push commit / tag, eg `git push && git push --tags`.

9.  Pushing a tag will trigger a release process in Evergreen which
    builds wheels for manylinux, macOS, and Windows. Wait for the
    "release-combine" task to complete and then download the "Release
    files all" archive. See https://spruce.mongodb.com/commits/mongo-python-driver?buildVariants=release&view=ALL

    The contents should look like this:

        $ ls path/to/archive
        pymongo-<version>-cp310-cp310-macosx_10_9_universal2.whl
        ...
        pymongo-<version>-cp38-cp38-manylinux2014_x86_64.whl
        ...
        pymongo-<version>-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
        ...
        pymongo-<version>.tar.gz

10.  Upload all the release packages to PyPI with twine:

        $ python3 -m twine upload path/to/archive/*

11. Make sure the new version appears on
    `https://pymongo.readthedocs.io/en/stable/`. If the new version does not show
    up automatically, trigger a rebuild of "latest" on https://readthedocs.org/projects/pymongo/builds/.

12. Publish the release version in Jira and add a description of the release, such as a the reason
    or the main feature.

13. Announce the release on the [community forum](https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/tags/c/announcements/driver-releases/110/python)

14. File a ticket for DOCSP highlighting changes in server version and
    Python version compatibility or the lack thereof, for example https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/DOCSP-34040

15. Create a GitHub Release for the tag using https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver/releases/new.
    The title should be "PyMongo X.Y.Z", and the description should
    contain a link to the release notes on the the community forum, e.g.
    "Release notes: mongodb.com/community/forums/t/pymongo-4-0-2-released/150457"
