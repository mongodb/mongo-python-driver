# Go through all versions that may have been skipped to detect
# when the task started failing
stepback: true

# Mark a failure as a system/bootstrap failure (purple box) rather then a task
# failure by default.
# Actual testing tasks are marked with `type: test`

# Good rule of thumb: the averageish length a task takes, times 5
