# When a task that used to pass starts to fail
# Go through all versions that may have been skipped to detect
# when the task started failing
stepback: true

# Mark a failure as a system/bootstrap failure (purple box) rather then a task
# failure by default.
# Actual testing tasks are marked with `type: test`
command_type: system

# Protect ourselves against rogue test case, or curl gone wild, that runs forever
# Good rule of thumb: the averageish length a task takes, times 5
# That roughly accounts for variable system performance for various buildvariants
exec_timeout_secs: 3600 # 60 minutes is the longest we'll ever run (primarily
                        # for macos hosts)

# What to do when evergreen hits the timeout (`post:` tasks are run automatically)
