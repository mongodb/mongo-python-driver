"""Tools to monitor driver events.

.. versionadded:: 3.1

.. attention:: Starting in PyMongo 3.11, the monitoring classes outlined below
    are included in the PyMongo distribution under the
    :mod:`~pymongo.event_loggers` submodule.

Use :func:`register` to register global listeners for specific events.
Listeners must inherit from one of the abstract classes below and implement
the correct functions for that class.

For example, a simple command logger might be implemented like this::

    import logging

    from pymongo import monitoring

    class CommandLogger(monitoring.CommandListener):

        def started(self, event):
            logging.info("Command {0.command_name} with request id "
                         "{0.request_id} started on server "
                         "{0.connection_id}".format(event))

        def succeeded(self, event):
            logging.info("Command {0.command_name} with request id "
                         "{0.request_id} on server {0.connection_id} "
                         "succeeded in {0.duration_micros} "
                         "microseconds".format(event))

        def failed(self, event):
            logging.info("Command {0.command_name} with request id "
                         "{0.request_id} on server {0.connection_id} "
                         "failed in {0.duration_micros} "
                         "microseconds".format(event))

    monitoring.register(CommandLogger())

Server discovery and monitoring events are also available. For example::

    class ServerLogger(monitoring.ServerListener):

        def opened(self, event):
            logging.info("Server {0.server_address} added to topology "
                         "{0.topology_id}".format(event))

        def description_changed(self, event):
            previous_server_type = event.previous_description.server_type
            new_server_type = event.new_description.server_type
            if new_server_type != previous_server_type:
                # server_type_name was added in PyMongo 3.4
                logging.info(
                    "Server {0.server_address} changed type from "
                    "{0.previous_description.server_type_name} to "
                    "{0.new_description.server_type_name}".format(event))

        def closed(self, event):
            logging.warning("Server {0.server_address} removed from topology "
                            "{0.topology_id}".format(event))


    class HeartbeatLogger(monitoring.ServerHeartbeatListener):

        def started(self, event):
            logging.info("Heartbeat sent to server "
                         "{0.connection_id}".format(event))

        def succeeded(self, event):
            # The reply.document attribute was added in PyMongo 3.4.
            logging.info("Heartbeat to server {0.connection_id} "
                         "succeeded with reply "
                         "{0.reply.document}".format(event))

        def failed(self, event):
            logging.warning("Heartbeat to server {0.connection_id} "
                            "failed with error {0.reply}".format(event))

    class TopologyLogger(monitoring.TopologyListener):

        def opened(self, event):
            logging.info("Topology with id {0.topology_id} "
                         "opened".format(event))

        def description_changed(self, event):
            logging.info("Topology description updated for "
                         "topology id {0.topology_id}".format(event))
            previous_topology_type = event.previous_description.topology_type
            new_topology_type = event.new_description.topology_type
            if new_topology_type != previous_topology_type:
                # topology_type_name was added in PyMongo 3.4
                logging.info(
                    "Topology {0.topology_id} changed type from "
                    "{0.previous_description.topology_type_name} to "
                    "{0.new_description.topology_type_name}".format(event))
            # The has_writable_server and has_readable_server methods
            # were added in PyMongo 3.4.
            if not event.new_description.has_writable_server():
                logging.warning("No writable servers available.")
            if not event.new_description.has_readable_server():
                logging.warning("No readable servers available.")

        def closed(self, event):
            logging.info("Topology with id {0.topology_id} "
                         "closed".format(event))

Connection monitoring and pooling events are also available. For example::

    class ConnectionPoolLogger(ConnectionPoolListener):

        def pool_created(self, event):
            logging.info("[pool {0.address}] pool created".format(event))

        def pool_cleared(self, event):
            logging.info("[pool {0.address}] pool cleared".format(event))

        def pool_closed(self, event):
            logging.info("[pool {0.address}] pool closed".format(event))

        def connection_created(self, event):
            logging.info("[pool {0.address}][conn #{0.connection_id}] "
                         "connection created".format(event))

        def connection_ready(self, event):
            logging.info("[pool {0.address}][conn #{0.connection_id}] "
                         "connection setup succeeded".format(event))

        def connection_closed(self, event):
            logging.info("[pool {0.address}][conn #{0.connection_id}] "
                         "connection closed, reason: "
                         "{0.reason}".format(event))

        def connection_check_out_started(self, event):
            logging.info("[pool {0.address}] connection check out "
                         "started".format(event))

        def connection_check_out_failed(self, event):
            logging.info("[pool {0.address}] connection check out "
                         "failed, reason: {0.reason}".format(event))

        def connection_checked_out(self, event):
            logging.info("[pool {0.address}][conn #{0.connection_id}] "
                         "connection checked out of pool".format(event))

        def connection_checked_in(self, event):
            logging.info("[pool {0.address}][conn #{0.connection_id}] "
                         "connection checked into pool".format(event))


Event listeners can also be registered per instance of
:class:`~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient`::

    client = MongoClient(event_listeners=[CommandLogger()])

Note that previously registered global listeners are automatically included
when configuring per client event listeners. Registering a new global listener
will not add that listener to existing client instances.

.. note:: Events are delivered **synchronously**. Application threads block
  waiting for event handlers (e.g. :meth:`~CommandListener.started`) to
  return. Care must be taken to ensure that your event handlers are efficient
  enough to not adversely affect overall application performance.

.. warning:: The command documents published through this API are *not* copies.
  If you intend to modify them in any way you must copy them in your event
  handler first.
