        :Parameters:
          - `pair`: a (hostname, port) tuple
          - `max_size`: The maximum number of open sockets. Calls to
            `get_socket` will block if this is set, this pool has opened
            `max_size` sockets, and there are none idle. Set to `None` to
             disable.
          - `net_timeout`: timeout in seconds for operations on open connection
          - `conn_timeout`: timeout in seconds for establishing connection
          - `use_ssl`: bool, if True use an encrypted connection
          - `use_greenlets`: bool, if True then start_request() assigns a
              socket to the current greenlet - otherwise it is assigned to the
              current thread
          - `ssl_keyfile`: The private keyfile used to identify the local
            connection against mongod.  If included with the ``certfile` then
            only the ``ssl_certfile`` is needed.  Implies ``ssl=True``.
          - `ssl_certfile`: The certificate file used to identify the local
            connection against mongod. Implies ``ssl=True``.
          - `ssl_cert_reqs`: Specifies whether a certificate is required from
            the other side of the connection, and whether it will be validated
            if provided. It must be one of the three values ``ssl.CERT_NONE``
            (certificates ignored), ``ssl.CERT_OPTIONAL``
            (not required, but validated if provided), or ``ssl.CERT_REQUIRED``
            (required and validated). If the value of this parameter is not
            ``ssl.CERT_NONE``, then the ``ssl_ca_certs`` parameter must point
            to a file of CA certificates. Implies ``ssl=True``.
          - `ssl_ca_certs`: The ca_certs file contains a set of concatenated
            "certification authority" certificates, which are used to validate
            certificates passed from the other end of the connection.
            Implies ``ssl=True``.
          - `wait_queue_timeout`: (integer) How long (in seconds) a
            thread will wait for a socket from the pool if the pool has no
            free sockets.
          - `wait_queue_multiple`: (integer) Multiplied by max_pool_size to give
            the number of threads allowed to wait for a socket at one time.
          - `socket_keepalive`: (boolean) Whether to send periodic keep-alive
            packets on connected sockets. Defaults to ``False`` (do not send
            keep-alive packets).
          - `ssl_validate_hostname`: (boolean) Whether to validate the hostname
            when a ``ssl_ca_cert`` is provided to be validated. Defaults to
            ``True``.
