          - `use_ssl`: bool, if True use an encrypted connection
          - `use_greenlets`: bool, if True then start_request() assigns a
              socket to the current greenlet - otherwise it is assigned to the
              current thread

            connection against mongod.  If included with the ``certfile` then

            connection against mongod. Implies ``ssl=True``.
          - `ssl_cert_reqs`: Specifies whether a certificate is required from
            the other side of the connection, and whether it will be validated
            if provided. It must be one of the three values ``ssl.CERT_NONE``

            "certification authority" certificates, which are used to validate
            certificates passed from the other end of the connection.
            Implies ``ssl=True``.
