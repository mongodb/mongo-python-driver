"""Tools for connecting to MongoDB.

.. seealso:: :doc:`/examples/high_availability` for examples of connecting
   to replica sets or sets of mongos servers.

To get a :class:`~pymongo.asynchronous.database.AsyncDatabase` instance from a
:class:`AsyncMongoClient` use either dictionary-style or attribute-style
access:

.. doctest::

        .. warning:: Starting in PyMongo 4.0, ``directConnection`` now has a default value of
          False instead of None.
          For more details, see the relevant section of the PyMongo 4.x migration guide:
          :ref:`pymongo4-migration-direct-connection`.

        .. warning:: This API is currently in beta, meaning the classes, methods, and behaviors described within may change before the full release.

        The client object is thread-safe and has connection-pooling built in.
        If an operation fails because of a network error,
        :class:`~pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure` is raised and the client
        reconnects in the background. Application code should handle this
        exception (recognizing that the operation failed) and then continue to
        execute.

        The `host` parameter can be a full `mongodb URI
        <http://dochub.mongodb.org/core/connections>`_, in addition to
        a simple hostname. It can also be a list of hostnames but no more
        than one URI. Any port specified in the host string(s) will override
        the `port` parameter. For username and
        passwords reserved characters like ':', '/', '+' and '@' must be
        percent encoded following RFC 2396::

            from urllib.parse import quote_plus

            uri = "mongodb://%s:%s@%s" % (
                quote_plus(user), quote_plus(password), host)
            client = AsyncMongoClient(uri)

        Unix domain sockets are also supported. The socket path must be percent
        encoded in the URI::

            uri = "mongodb://%s:%s@%s" % (
                quote_plus(user), quote_plus(password), quote_plus(socket_path))
            client = AsyncMongoClient(uri)

        But not when passed as a simple hostname::

            client = AsyncMongoClient('/tmp/mongodb-27017.sock')

        Starting with version 3.6, PyMongo supports mongodb+srv:// URIs. The
        URI must include one, and only one, hostname. The hostname will be
        resolved to one or more DNS `SRV records
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV_record>`_ which will be used
        as the seed list for connecting to the MongoDB deployment. When using
        SRV URIs, the `authSource` and `replicaSet` configuration options can
        be specified using `TXT records
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TXT_record>`_. See the
        `Initial DNS Seedlist Discovery spec
        <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/
        initial-dns-seedlist-discovery/initial-dns-seedlist-discovery.rst>`_
        for more details. Note that the use of SRV URIs implicitly enables
        TLS support. Pass tls=false in the URI to override.

        .. note:: AsyncMongoClient creation will block waiting for answers from
          DNS when mongodb+srv:// URIs are used.

        .. note:: Starting with version 3.0 the :class:`AsyncMongoClient`
          constructor no longer blocks while connecting to the server or
          servers, and it no longer raises
          :class:`~pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure` if they are
          unavailable, nor :class:`~pymongo.errors.ConfigurationError`
          if the user's credentials are wrong. Instead, the constructor
          returns immediately and launches the connection process on
          background threads. You can check if the server is available
          like this::

            from pymongo.errors import ConnectionFailure
            client = AsyncMongoClient()
            try:
                # The ping command is cheap and does not require auth.
                client.admin.command('ping')
            except ConnectionFailure:
                print("Server not available")

        .. warning:: When using PyMongo in a multiprocessing context, please
          read :ref:`multiprocessing` first.

        .. note:: Many of the following options can be passed using a MongoDB
          URI or keyword parameters. If the same option is passed in a URI and
          as a keyword parameter the keyword parameter takes precedence.

        :param host: hostname or IP address or Unix domain socket
            path of a single mongod or mongos instance to connect to, or a
            mongodb URI, or a list of hostnames (but no more than one mongodb
            URI). If `host` is an IPv6 literal it must be enclosed in '['
            and ']' characters
            following the RFC2732 URL syntax (e.g. '[::1]' for localhost).
            Multihomed and round robin DNS addresses are **not** supported.
        :param port: port number on which to connect
        :param document_class: default class to use for
            documents returned from queries on this client
        :param tz_aware: if ``True``,
            :class:`~datetime.datetime` instances returned as values
            in a document by this :class:`AsyncMongoClient` will be timezone
            aware (otherwise they will be naive)
        :param connect: **Not supported by AsyncMongoClient**.
        :param type_registry: instance of
            :class:`~bson.codec_options.TypeRegistry` to enable encoding
            and decoding of custom types.
        :param datetime_conversion: Specifies how UTC datetimes should be decoded
            within BSON. Valid options include 'datetime_ms' to return as a
            DatetimeMS, 'datetime' to return as a datetime.datetime and
            raising a ValueError for out-of-range values, 'datetime_auto' to
            return DatetimeMS objects when the underlying datetime is
            out-of-range and 'datetime_clamp' to clamp to the minimum and
            maximum possible datetimes. Defaults to 'datetime'. See
            :ref:`handling-out-of-range-datetimes` for details.

          | **Other optional parameters can be passed as keyword arguments:**

          - `directConnection` (optional): if ``True``, forces this client to
             connect directly to the specified MongoDB host as a standalone.
             If ``false``, the client connects to the entire replica set of
             which the given MongoDB host(s) is a part. If this is ``True``
             and a mongodb+srv:// URI or a URI containing multiple seeds is
             provided, an exception will be raised.
          - `maxPoolSize` (optional): The maximum allowable number of
            concurrent connections to each connected server. Requests to a
            server will block if there are `maxPoolSize` outstanding
            connections to the requested server. Defaults to 100. Can be
            either 0 or None, in which case there is no limit on the number
            of concurrent connections.
          - `minPoolSize` (optional): The minimum required number of concurrent
            connections that the pool will maintain to each connected server.
            Default is 0.
          - `maxIdleTimeMS` (optional): The maximum number of milliseconds that
            a connection can remain idle in the pool before being removed and
            replaced. Defaults to `None` (no limit).
          - `maxConnecting` (optional): The maximum number of connections that
            each pool can establish concurrently. Defaults to `2`.
          - `timeoutMS`: (integer or None) Controls how long (in
            milliseconds) the driver will wait when executing an operation
            (including retry attempts) before raising a timeout error.
            ``0`` or ``None`` means no timeout.
          - `socketTimeoutMS`: (integer or None) Controls how long (in
            milliseconds) the driver will wait for a response after sending an
            ordinary (non-monitoring) database operation before concluding that
            a network error has occurred. ``0`` or ``None`` means no timeout.
            Defaults to ``None`` (no timeout).
          - `connectTimeoutMS`: (integer or None) Controls how long (in
            milliseconds) the driver will wait during server monitoring when
            connecting a new socket to a server before concluding the server
            is unavailable. ``0`` or ``None`` means no timeout.
            Defaults to ``20000`` (20 seconds).
          - `server_selector`: (callable or None) Optional, user-provided
            function that augments server selection rules. The function should
            accept as an argument a list of
            :class:`~pymongo.server_description.ServerDescription` objects and
            return a list of server descriptions that should be considered
            suitable for the desired operation.
          - `serverSelectionTimeoutMS`: (integer) Controls how long (in
            milliseconds) the driver will wait to find an available,
            appropriate server to carry out a database operation; while it is
            waiting, multiple server monitoring operations may be carried out,
            each controlled by `connectTimeoutMS`. Defaults to ``30000`` (30
            seconds).
          - `waitQueueTimeoutMS`: (integer or None) How long (in milliseconds)
            a thread will wait for a socket from the pool if the pool has no
            free sockets. Defaults to ``None`` (no timeout).
          - `heartbeatFrequencyMS`: (optional) The number of milliseconds
            between periodic server checks, or None to accept the default
            frequency of 10 seconds.
          - `serverMonitoringMode`: (optional) The server monitoring mode to use.
            Valid values are the strings: "auto", "stream", "poll". Defaults to "auto".
          - `appname`: (string or None) The name of the application that
            created this AsyncMongoClient instance. The server will log this value
            upon establishing each connection. It is also recorded in the slow
            query log and profile collections.
          - `driver`: (pair or None) A driver implemented on top of PyMongo can
            pass a :class:`~pymongo.driver_info.DriverInfo` to add its name,
            version, and platform to the message printed in the server log when
            establishing a connection.
          - `event_listeners`: a list or tuple of event listeners. See
            :mod:`~pymongo.monitoring` for details.
          - `retryWrites`: (boolean) Whether supported write operations
            executed within this AsyncMongoClient will be retried once after a
            network error. Defaults to ``True``.
            The supported write operations are:

              - :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.collection.AsyncCollection.bulk_write`, as long as
                :class:`~pymongo.asynchronous.operations.UpdateMany` or
                :class:`~pymongo.asynchronous.operations.DeleteMany` are not included.
              - :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.collection.AsyncCollection.delete_one`
              - :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.collection.AsyncCollection.insert_one`
              - :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.collection.AsyncCollection.insert_many`
              - :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.collection.AsyncCollection.replace_one`
              - :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.collection.AsyncCollection.update_one`
              - :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.collection.AsyncCollection.find_one_and_delete`
              - :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.collection.AsyncCollection.find_one_and_replace`
              - :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.collection.AsyncCollection.find_one_and_update`

            Unsupported write operations include, but are not limited to,
            :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.collection.AsyncCollection.aggregate` using the ``$out``
            pipeline operator and any operation with an unacknowledged write
            concern (e.g. {w: 0})). See
            https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/retryable-writes/retryable-writes.rst
          - `retryReads`: (boolean) Whether supported read operations
            executed within this AsyncMongoClient will be retried once after a
            network error. Defaults to ``True``.
            The supported read operations are:
            :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.collection.AsyncCollection.find`,
            :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.collection.AsyncCollection.find_one`,
            :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.collection.AsyncCollection.aggregate` without ``$out``,
            :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.collection.AsyncCollection.distinct`,
            :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.collection.AsyncCollection.count`,
            :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.collection.AsyncCollection.estimated_document_count`,
            :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.collection.AsyncCollection.count_documents`,
            :meth:`pymongo.asynchronous.collection.AsyncCollection.watch`,
            :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.collection.AsyncCollection.list_indexes`,
            :meth:`pymongo.asynchronous.database.AsyncDatabase.watch`,
            :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.database.AsyncDatabase.list_collections`,
            :meth:`pymongo.asynchronous.mongo_client.AsyncMongoClient.watch`,
            and :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.mongo_client.AsyncMongoClient.list_databases`.

            Unsupported read operations include, but are not limited to
            :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.database.AsyncDatabase.command` and any getMore
            operation on a cursor.

            Enabling retryable reads makes applications more resilient to
            transient errors such as network failures, database upgrades, and
            replica set failovers. For an exact definition of which errors
            trigger a retry, see the `retryable reads specification
            <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/retryable-reads/retryable-reads.rst>`_.

          - `compressors`: Comma separated list of compressors for wire
            protocol compression. The list is used to negotiate a compressor
            with the server. Currently supported options are "snappy", "zlib"
            and "zstd". Support for snappy requires the
            `python-snappy <https://pypi.org/project/python-snappy/>`_ package.
            zlib support requires the Python standard library zlib module. zstd
            requires the `zstandard <https://pypi.org/project/zstandard/>`_
            package. By default no compression is used. Compression support
            must also be enabled on the server. MongoDB 3.6+ supports snappy
            and zlib compression. MongoDB 4.2+ adds support for zstd.
            See :ref:`network-compression-example` for details.
          - `zlibCompressionLevel`: (int) The zlib compression level to use
            when zlib is used as the wire protocol compressor. Supported values
            are -1 through 9. -1 tells the zlib library to use its default
            compression level (usually 6). 0 means no compression. 1 is best
            speed. 9 is best compression. Defaults to -1.
          - `uuidRepresentation`: The BSON representation to use when encoding
            from and decoding to instances of :class:`~uuid.UUID`. Valid
            values are the strings: "standard", "pythonLegacy", "javaLegacy",
            "csharpLegacy", and "unspecified" (the default). New applications
            should consider setting this to "standard" for cross language
            compatibility. See :ref:`handling-uuid-data-example` for details.
          - `unicode_decode_error_handler`: The error handler to apply when
            a Unicode-related error occurs during BSON decoding that would
            otherwise raise :exc:`UnicodeDecodeError`. Valid options include
            'strict', 'replace', 'backslashreplace', 'surrogateescape', and
            'ignore'. Defaults to 'strict'.
          - `srvServiceName`: (string) The SRV service name to use for
            "mongodb+srv://" URIs. Defaults to "mongodb". Use it like so::

                AsyncMongoClient("mongodb+srv://example.com/?srvServiceName=customname")
          - `srvMaxHosts`: (int) limits the number of mongos-like hosts a client will
            connect to. More specifically, when a "mongodb+srv://" connection string
            resolves to more than srvMaxHosts number of hosts, the client will randomly
            choose an srvMaxHosts sized subset of hosts.


          | **Write Concern options:**
          | (Only set if passed. No default values.)

          - `w`: (integer or string) If this is a replica set, write operations
            will block until they have been replicated to the specified number
            or tagged set of servers. `w=<int>` always includes the replica set
            primary (e.g. w=3 means write to the primary and wait until
            replicated to **two** secondaries). Passing w=0 **disables write
            acknowledgement** and all other write concern options.
          - `wTimeoutMS`: **DEPRECATED** (integer) Used in conjunction with `w`.
            Specify a value in milliseconds to control how long to wait for write propagation
            to complete. If replication does not complete in the given
            timeframe, a timeout exception is raised. Passing wTimeoutMS=0
            will cause **write operations to wait indefinitely**.
          - `journal`: If ``True`` block until write operations have been
            committed to the journal. Cannot be used in combination with
            `fsync`. Write operations will fail with an exception if this
            option is used when the server is running without journaling.
          - `fsync`: If ``True`` and the server is running without journaling,
            blocks until the server has synced all data files to disk. If the
            server is running with journaling, this acts the same as the `j`
            option, blocking until write operations have been committed to the
            journal. Cannot be used in combination with `j`.

          | **Replica set keyword arguments for connecting with a replica set
            - either directly or via a mongos:**

          - `replicaSet`: (string or None) The name of the replica set to
            connect to. The driver will verify that all servers it connects to
            match this name. Implies that the hosts specified are a seed list
            and the driver should attempt to find all members of the set.
            Defaults to ``None``.

          | **Read Preference:**

          - `readPreference`: The replica set read preference for this client.
            One of ``primary``, ``primaryPreferred``, ``secondary``,
            ``secondaryPreferred``, or ``nearest``. Defaults to ``primary``.
          - `readPreferenceTags`: Specifies a tag set as a comma-separated list
            of colon-separated key-value pairs. For example ``dc:ny,rack:1``.
            Defaults to ``None``.
          - `maxStalenessSeconds`: (integer) The maximum estimated
            length of time a replica set secondary can fall behind the primary
            in replication before it will no longer be selected for operations.
            Defaults to ``-1``, meaning no maximum. If maxStalenessSeconds
            is set, it must be a positive integer greater than or equal to
            90 seconds.

          .. seealso:: :doc:`/examples/server_selection`

          | **Authentication:**

          - `username`: A string.
          - `password`: A string.

            Although username and password must be percent-escaped in a MongoDB
            URI, they must not be percent-escaped when passed as parameters. In
            this example, both the space and slash special characters are passed
            as-is::

              AsyncMongoClient(username="user name", password="pass/word")

          - `authSource`: The database to authenticate on. Defaults to the
            database specified in the URI, if provided, or to "admin".
          - `authMechanism`: See :data:`~pymongo.auth.MECHANISMS` for options.
            If no mechanism is specified, PyMongo automatically SCRAM-SHA-1
            when connected to MongoDB 3.6 and negotiates the mechanism to use
            (SCRAM-SHA-1 or SCRAM-SHA-256) when connected to MongoDB 4.0+.
          - `authMechanismProperties`: Used to specify authentication mechanism
            specific options. To specify the service name for GSSAPI
            authentication pass authMechanismProperties='SERVICE_NAME:<service
            name>'.
            To specify the session token for MONGODB-AWS authentication pass
            ``authMechanismProperties='AWS_SESSION_TOKEN:<session token>'``.

          .. seealso:: :doc:`/examples/authentication`

          | **TLS/SSL configuration:**

          - `tls`: (boolean) If ``True``, create the connection to the server
            using transport layer security. Defaults to ``False``.
          - `tlsInsecure`: (boolean) Specify whether TLS constraints should be
            relaxed as much as possible. Setting ``tlsInsecure=True`` implies
            ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates=True`` and
            ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames=True``. Defaults to ``False``. Think
            very carefully before setting this to ``True`` as it dramatically
            reduces the security of TLS.
          - `tlsAllowInvalidCertificates`: (boolean) If ``True``, continues
            the TLS handshake regardless of the outcome of the certificate
            verification process. If this is ``False``, and a value is not
            provided for ``tlsCAFile``, PyMongo will attempt to load system
            provided CA certificates. If the python version in use does not
            support loading system CA certificates then the ``tlsCAFile``
            parameter must point to a file of CA certificates.
            ``tlsAllowInvalidCertificates=False`` implies ``tls=True``.
            Defaults to ``False``. Think very carefully before setting this
            to ``True`` as that could make your application vulnerable to
            on-path attackers.
          - `tlsAllowInvalidHostnames`: (boolean) If ``True``, disables TLS
            hostname verification. ``tlsAllowInvalidHostnames=False`` implies
            ``tls=True``. Defaults to ``False``. Think very carefully before
            setting this to ``True`` as that could make your application
            vulnerable to on-path attackers.
          - `tlsCAFile`: A file containing a single or a bundle of
            "certification authority" certificates, which are used to validate
            certificates passed from the other end of the connection.
            Implies ``tls=True``. Defaults to ``None``.
          - `tlsCertificateKeyFile`: A file containing the client certificate
            and private key. Implies ``tls=True``. Defaults to ``None``.
          - `tlsCRLFile`: A file containing a PEM or DER formatted
            certificate revocation list. Implies ``tls=True``. Defaults to
            ``None``.
          - `tlsCertificateKeyFilePassword`: The password or passphrase for
            decrypting the private key in ``tlsCertificateKeyFile``. Only
            necessary if the private key is encrypted. Defaults to ``None``.
          - `tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck`: (boolean) If ``True``, disables
            certificate revocation status checking via the OCSP responder
            specified on the server certificate.
            ``tlsDisableOCSPEndpointCheck=False`` implies ``tls=True``.
            Defaults to ``False``.
          - `ssl`: (boolean) Alias for ``tls``.

          | **Read Concern options:**
          | (If not set explicitly, this will use the server default)

          - `readConcernLevel`: (string) The read concern level specifies the
            level of isolation for read operations.  For example, a read
            operation using a read concern level of ``majority`` will only
            return data that has been written to a majority of nodes. If the
            level is left unspecified, the server default will be used.

          | **Client side encryption options:**
          | (If not set explicitly, client side encryption will not be enabled.)

          - `auto_encryption_opts`: A
            :class:`~pymongo.encryption_options.AutoEncryptionOpts` which
            configures this client to automatically encrypt collection commands
            and automatically decrypt results. See
            :ref:`automatic-client-side-encryption` for an example.
            If a :class:`AsyncMongoClient` is configured with
            ``auto_encryption_opts`` and a non-None ``maxPoolSize``, a
            separate internal ``AsyncMongoClient`` is created if any of the
            following are true:

              - A ``key_vault_client`` is not passed to
                :class:`~pymongo.encryption_options.AutoEncryptionOpts`
              - ``bypass_auto_encrpytion=False`` is passed to
                :class:`~pymongo.encryption_options.AutoEncryptionOpts`

          | **Stable API options:**
          | (If not set explicitly, Stable API will not be enabled.)

          - `server_api`: A
            :class:`~pymongo.server_api.ServerApi` which configures this
            client to use Stable API. See :ref:`versioned-api-ref` for
            details.

           ``socketKeepAlive`` now defaults to ``True``.

        .. versionchanged:: 3.0
           :class:`~pymongo.asynchronous.mongo_client.AsyncMongoClient` is now the one and only
           client class for a standalone server, mongos, or replica set.
           It includes the functionality that had been split into
           :class:`~pymongo.asynchronous.mongo_client.MongoReplicaSetClient`: it can connect
           to a replica set, discover all its members, and monitor the set for
           stepdowns, elections, and reconfigs.

           The :class:`~pymongo.asynchronous.mongo_client.AsyncMongoClient` constructor no
           longer blocks while connecting to the server or servers, and it no
           longer raises :class:`~pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure` if they
           are unavailable, nor :class:`~pymongo.errors.ConfigurationError`
           if the user's credentials are wrong. Instead, the constructor
           returns immediately and launches the connection process on
           background threads.

           Therefore the ``alive`` method is removed since it no longer
           provides meaningful information; even if the client is disconnected,
           it may discover a server in time to fulfill the next operation.

           In PyMongo 2.x, :class:`~pymongo.asynchronous.AsyncMongoClient` accepted a list of
           standalone MongoDB servers and used the first it could connect to::

               AsyncMongoClient(['host1.com:27017', 'host2.com:27017'])

           A list of multiple standalones is no longer supported; if multiple
           servers are listed they must be members of the same replica set, or
           mongoses in the same sharded cluster.

           The behavior for a list of mongoses is changed from "high
           availability" to "load balancing". Before, the client connected to
           the lowest-latency mongos in the list, and used it until a network
           error prompted it to re-evaluate all mongoses' latencies and
           reconnect to one of them. In PyMongo 3, the client monitors its
           network latency to all the mongoses continuously, and distributes
           operations evenly among those with the lowest latency. See
           :ref:`mongos-load-balancing` for more information.

           The ``connect`` option is added.

           The ``start_request``, ``in_request``, and ``end_request`` methods
           are removed, as well as the ``auto_start_request`` option.

           The ``copy_database`` method is removed, see the
           :doc:`copy_database examples </examples/copydb>` for alternatives.

           The :meth:`AsyncMongoClient.disconnect` method is removed; it was a
           synonym for :meth:`~pymongo.asynchronous.AsyncMongoClient.close`.

           :class:`~pymongo.asynchronous.mongo_client.AsyncMongoClient` no longer returns an
           instance of :class:`~pymongo.asynchronous.database.AsyncDatabase` for attribute names
           with leading underscores. You must use dict-style lookups instead::

               client['__my_database__']

           Not::

               client.__my_database__

        .. versionchanged:: 4.7
            Deprecated parameter ``wTimeoutMS``, use :meth:`~pymongo.timeout`.

        .. versionchanged:: 4.9
            The default value of ``connect`` is changed to ``False`` when running in a
            Function-as-a-service environment.

            to the ``$changeStream`` stage. Allowed values: 'updateLookup',
            'whenAvailable', 'required'. When set to 'updateLookup', the

            and 'required'. Change events may now result in a
            'fullDocumentBeforeChange' response field.

            change stream will start returning changes that occur directly
            after the operation specified in the resume token. A resume token
            is the _id value of a change document.
        :param max_await_time_ms: The maximum time in milliseconds
            for the server to wait for changes before responding to a getMore
            operation.

            per batch.

            to use for the aggregation.
        :param start_at_operation_time: If provided, the resulting
            change stream will only return changes that occurred at or after
            the specified :class:`~bson.timestamp.Timestamp`. Requires
            MongoDB >= 4.0.
