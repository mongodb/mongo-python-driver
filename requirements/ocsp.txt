# PyOpenSSL 17.0.0 introduced support for OCSP. 
# 17.1.0 introduced a related feature we need.
# 17.2.0 fixes a bug in set_default_verify_paths we should really avoid.
#
# PyOpenSSL < 23.2.0 is incompatible with cryptography >= 42.0.0; PyOpenSSL
# 23.2.0 stopped referencing X509_V_FLAG_NOTIFY_POLICY that was removed in 
# cryptography 42.0.0. Using compatible minimum versions is an easy solution.
pyopenssl>=23.2.0
cryptography>=42.0.0
# service_identity 18.1.0 introduced support for IP addr matching.
# Fallback to certifi on Windows if we can't load CA certs from the system
# store and just use certifi on macOS.
