"""Tools for representing JavaScript code in BSON.

class Code(str):
    """BSON's JavaScript code type.

    Raises :class:`TypeError` if `code` is not an instance of
    :class:`basestring` or `scope` is not ``None`` or an instance of
    :class:`dict`.

    Scope variables can be set by passing a dictionary as the `scope`
    argument or by using keyword arguments. If a variable is set as a
    keyword argument it will override any setting for that variable in
    the `scope` dictionary.

    :Parameters:
      - `code`: string containing JavaScript code to be evaluated
      - `scope` (optional): dictionary representing the scope in which
        `code` should be evaluated - a mapping from identifiers (as
        strings) to values
      - `**kwargs` (optional): scope variables can also be passed as
        keyword arguments

    .. versionadded:: 1.9
       Ability to pass scope values using keyword arguments.
