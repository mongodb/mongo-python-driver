Changelog
=========

Changes in Version 2.5.2+
-------------------------

Important new features:

- The `max_pool_size` option for :class:`~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient` and
  :class:`~pymongo.mongo_replica_set_client.MongoReplicaSetClient` now actually
  caps the number of sockets the pool will open concurrently. Connection or
  query attempts when the pool has reached `max_pool_size` block waiting for a
  socket to be returned to the pool. If ``waitQueueTimeoutMS`` is set, an
  operation that blocks waiting for a socket will raise
  :exc:`~pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure` after the timeout. By default
  ``waitQueueTimeoutMS`` is not set.

.. warning:: SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIOR CHANGE in 2.5.2+. Previously, `max_pool_size`
  would limit only the idle sockets the pool would hold onto, not the
  number of open sockets. The default has also changed, from 10 to 100.

Changes in Version 2.5.2
------------------------

Version 2.5.2 fixes a NULL pointer dereference issue when decoding
an invalid :class:`~bson.dbref.DBRef`.

Changes in Version 2.4
----------------------

Version 2.4 includes a few important new features and a large number of bug
fixes.

Important new features:

- New :class:`~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient` and
  :class:`~pymongo.mongo_replica_set_client.MongoReplicaSetClient` classes -
  these connection classes do acknowledged write operations (previously referred
  to as 'safe' writes) by default. :class:`~pymongo.connection.Connection` and
  :class:`~pymongo.replica_set_connection.ReplicaSetConnection` are deprecated
  but still support the old default fire-and-forget behavior.
- A new write concern API implemented as a
  :attr:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.write_concern` attribute on the connection,
  :class:`~pymongo.database.Database`, or :class:`~pymongo.collection.Collection`
  classes.
- :class:`~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient` (and :class:`~pymongo.connection.Connection`)
  now support Unix Domain Sockets.
- :class:`~pymongo.cursor.Cursor` can be copied with functions from the :mod:`copy`
  module.
- The :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.set_profiling_level` method now supports
  a `slow_ms` option.
- The replica set monitor task (used by
  :class:`~pymongo.mongo_replica_set_client.MongoReplicaSetClient` and
  :class:`~pymongo.replica_set_connection.ReplicaSetConnection`) is a daemon thread
  once again, meaning you won't have to call
  :meth:`~pymongo.mongo_replica_set_client.MongoReplicaSetClient.close` before
  exiting the python interactive shell.

.. warning::

    The constructors for :class:`~pymongo.mongo_client.MongoClient`,
    :class:`~pymongo.mongo_replica_set_client.MongoReplicaSetClient`,
    :class:`~pymongo.connection.Connection`, and
    :class:`~pymongo.replica_set_connection.ReplicaSetConnection` now raise
    :exc:`~pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure` instead of its subclass
    :exc:`~pymongo.errors.AutoReconnect` if the server is unavailable. Applications
    that expect to catch :exc:`~pymongo.errors.AutoReconnect` should now catch
    :exc:`~pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure` while creating a new connection.

in this release.

.. _PyMongo 2.4 release notes in JIRA: https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON/fixforversion/11485

Changes in Version 2.3
----------------------

Version 2.3 adds support for new features and behavior changes in MongoDB
2.2.

Important New Features:

- Support for expanded read preferences including directing reads to tagged
  servers - See :ref:`secondary-reads` for more information.
- Support for mongos failover -
  See :ref:`mongos-high-availability` for more information.
- A new :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.aggregate` method to support
  MongoDB's new `aggregation framework
  <http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/applications/aggregation/>`_.
- Support for legacy Java and C# byte order when encoding and decoding UUIDs.
- Support for connecting directly to an arbiter.

.. warning::

    Starting with MongoDB 2.2 the getLastError command requires authentication
    when the server's `authentication features
    <http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Security+and+Authentication>`_ are enabled.
    Changes to PyMongo were required to support this behavior change. Users of
    authentication must upgrade to PyMongo 2.3 (or newer) for "safe" write operations
    to function correctly.

Changes in Version 2.2.1
------------------------

Version 2.2.1 is a minor release that fixes issues discovered after the
release of 2.2. Most importantly, this release fixes an incompatibility
with mod_wsgi 2.x that could cause connections to leak. Users of mod_wsgi
2.x are strongly encouraged to upgrade from PyMongo 2.2.

Changes in Version 2.2
-----------------------

Version 2.2 adds a few more frequently requested features and fixes a
number of bugs.

Special thanks go to Alex Gr√∂nholm for his contributions to Python 3
support and maintaining the original pymongo3 port. Christoph Simon,
Wouter Bolsterlee, Mike O'Brien, and Chris Tompkinson also contributed
to this release.

Important New Features:

- Support for Python 3 -
  See the :doc:`python3` for more information.
- Support for Gevent -
  See :doc:`examples/gevent` for more information.
- Improved connection pooling -
  See :doc:`examples/requests` for more information.

.. warning::

    A number of methods and method parameters that were deprecated in
    PyMongo 1.9 or older versions have been removed in this release.
    The full list of changes can be found in the following JIRA ticket:

    https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON-305

    BSON module aliases from the pymongo package that were deprecated in
    PyMongo 1.9 have also been removed in this release. See the following
    JIRA ticket for details:

    https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON-304

    As a result of this cleanup some minor code changes may be required
    to use this release.

Changes in Version 2.1.1
------------------------

Version 2.1.1 is a minor release that fixes a few issues
discovered after the release of 2.1. You can now use
:class:`~pymongo.replica_set_connection.ReplicaSetConnection`
to run inline map reduce commands on secondaries. See
:meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.inline_map_reduce` for details.

Special thanks go to Samuel Clay and Ross Lawley for their contributions
to this release.

Changes in Version 2.1
------------------------

Version 2.1 adds a few frequently requested features and includes the usual
round of bug fixes and improvements.

Special thanks go to Alexey Borzenkov, Dan Crosta, Kostya Rybnikov,
Flavio Percoco Premoli, Jonas Haag, and Jesse Davis for their contributions
to this release.

Important New Features:

- ReplicaSetConnection -
  :class:`~pymongo.replica_set_connection.ReplicaSetConnection`
  can be used to distribute reads to secondaries in a replica set. It supports
  automatic failover handling and periodically checks the state of the
  replica set to handle issues like primary stepdown or secondaries
  being removed for backup operations. Read preferences are defined through
  :class:`~pymongo.read_preferences.ReadPreference`.
- PyMongo supports the new BSON binary subtype 4 for UUIDs. The default
  subtype to use can be set through
  :attr:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.uuid_subtype`
  The current default remains :attr:`~bson.binary.OLD_UUID_SUBTYPE` but will
  be changed to :attr:`~bson.binary.UUID_SUBTYPE` in a future release.
- The getLastError option 'w' can be set to a string, allowing for options
  like "majority" available in newer version of MongoDB.
- Added support for the MongoDB URI options socketTimeoutMS and connectTimeoutMS.
- Added support for the ContinueOnError insert flag.
- Added basic SSL support.
- Added basic support for Jython.
- Secondaries can be used for :meth:`~pymongo.cursor.Cursor.count`,
  :meth:`~pymongo.cursor.Cursor.distinct`, :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.group`,
  and querying :class:`~gridfs.GridFS`.
- Added document_class and tz_aware options to
  :class:`~pymongo.master_slave_connection.MasterSlaveConnection`

Changes in Version 2.0.1
------------------------

Version 2.0.1 fixes a regression in :class:`~gridfs.grid_file.GridIn` when
writing pre-chunked strings. Thanks go to Alexey Borzenkov for reporting the
issue and submitting a patch.

Issues Resolved
...............

- `PYTHON-271 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON-271>`_:
  Regression in GridFS leads to serious loss of data.

Changes in Version 2.0
----------------------

Version 2.0 adds a large number of features and fixes a number of issues.

Special thanks go to James Murty, Abhay Vardhan, David Pisoni, Ryan Smith-Roberts,
Andrew Pendleton, Mher Movsisyan, Reed O'Brien, Michael Schurter, Josip Delic
and Jonas Haag for their contributions to this release.

Important New Features:

- PyMongo now performs automatic per-socket database authentication. You no
  longer have to re-authenticate for each new thread or after a replica set
  failover. Authentication credentials are cached by the driver until the
  application calls :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.logout`.
- slave_okay can be set independently at the connection, database, collection
  or query level. Each level will inherit the slave_okay setting from the
  previous level and each level can override the previous level's setting.
- safe and getLastError options (e.g. w, wtimeout, etc.) can be set
  independently at the connection, database, collection or query level. Each
  level will inherit settings from the previous level and each level can
  override the previous level's setting.
- PyMongo now supports the `await_data` and `partial` cursor flags. If the
  `await_data` flag is set on a `tailable` cursor the server will block for
  some extra time waiting for more data to return. The `partial` flag tells
  a mongos to return partial data for a query if not all shards are available.
- :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.map_reduce` will accept a `dict` or
  instance of :class:`~bson.son.SON` as the `out` parameter.
- The URI parser has been moved into its own module and can be used directly
  by application code.
- AutoReconnect exception now provides information about the error that
  actually occured instead of a generic failure message.
- A number of new helper methods have been added with options for setting and
  unsetting cursor flags, re-indexing a collection, fsync and locking a server,
  and getting the server's current operations.

API changes:

- If only one host:port pair is specified :class:`~pymongo.connection.Connection`
  will make a direct connection to only that host. Please note that `slave_okay`
  must be `True` in order to query from a secondary.
- If more than one host:port pair is specified or the `replicaset` option is
  used PyMongo will treat the specified host:port pair(s) as a seed list and
  connect using replica set behavior.

.. warning::

    The default subtype for :class:`~bson.binary.Binary` has changed
    from :const:`~bson.binary.OLD_BINARY_SUBTYPE` (2) to
    :const:`~bson.binary.BINARY_SUBTYPE` (0).

Changes in Version 1.11
-----------------------

Version 1.11 adds a few new features and fixes a few more bugs.

New Features:

- Basic IPv6 support: pymongo prefers IPv4 but will try IPv6. You can
  also specify an IPv6 address literal in the `host` parameter or a
  MongoDB URI provided it is enclosed in '[' and ']'.
- max_pool_size option: previously pymongo had a hard coded pool size
  of 10 connections. With this change you can specify a different pool
  size as a parameter to :class:`~pymongo.connection.Connection`
  (max_pool_size=<integer>) or in the MongoDB URI (maxPoolSize=<integer>).
- Find by metadata in GridFS: You can know specify query fields as
  keyword parameters for :meth:`~gridfs.GridFS.get_version` and
  :meth:`~gridfs.GridFS.get_last_version`.
- Per-query slave_okay option: slave_okay=True is now a valid keyword
  argument for :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find` and
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one`.

API changes:

- :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.validate_collection` now returns a
  dict instead of a string. This change was required to deal with an
  API change on the server. This method also now takes the optional
  `scandata` and `full` parameters. See the documentation for more
  details.

.. warning::  The `pool_size`, `auto_start_request`, and `timeout` parameters
              for :class:`~pymongo.connection.Connection` have been completely
              removed in this release. They were deprecated in pymongo-1.4 and
              have had no effect since then. Please make sure that your code
              doesn't currently pass these parameters when creating a
              Connection instance.

Issues resolved
...............

- `PYTHON-241 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON-241>`_:
  Support setting slaveok at the cursor level.
- `PYTHON-240 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON-240>`_:
  Queries can sometimes permanently fail after a replica set fail over.
- `PYTHON-238 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON-238>`_:
  error after few million requests
- `PYTHON-237 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON-237>`_:
  Basic IPv6 support.
- `PYTHON-236 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON-236>`_:
  Restore option to specify pool size in Connection.
- `PYTHON-212 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON-212>`_:
  pymongo does not recover after stale config
- `PYTHON-138 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON-138>`_:
  Find method for GridFS

Changes in Version 1.10.1
-------------------------

Version 1.10.1 is primarily a bugfix release. It fixes a regression in
version 1.10 that broke pickling of ObjectIds. A number of other bugs
have been fixed as well.

There are two behavior changes to be aware of:

- If a read slave raises :class:`~pymongo.errors.AutoReconnect`
  :class:`~pymongo.master_slave_connection.MasterSlaveConnection` will now
  retry the query on each slave until it is successful or all slaves have
  raised :class:`~pymongo.errors.AutoReconnect`. Any other exception will
  immediately be raised. The order that the slaves are tried is random.
  Previously the read would be sent to one randomly chosen slave and
  :class:`~pymongo.errors.AutoReconnect` was immediately raised in case
  of a connection failure.
- A Python `long` is now always BSON encoded as an int64. Previously the
  encoding was based only on the value of the field and a `long` with a
  value less than `2147483648` or greater than `-2147483649` would always
  be BSON encoded as an int32.

Issues resolved

  as_class option is not propogated by Cursor.clone
- `PYTHON-113 <https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/PYTHON-113>`_:
  Redunducy in MasterSlaveConnection

Changes in Version 1.10
-----------------------

Version 1.10 includes changes to support new features in MongoDB 1.8.x.
Highlights include a modified map/reduce API including an inline map/reduce
helper method, a new find_and_modify helper, and the ability to query the
server for the maximum BSON document size it supports.

- added :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_and_modify`.
- added :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.inline_map_reduce`.
- changed :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.map_reduce`.

.. warning:: MongoDB versions greater than 1.7.4 no longer generate temporary
   collections for map/reduce results. An output collection name must be
   provided and the output will replace any existing output collection with
   the same name. :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.map_reduce` now
   requires the `out` parameter.

Issues resolved
...............

- PYTHON-225: :class:`~pymongo.objectid.ObjectId` class definition should use __slots__.
- PYTHON-223: Documentation fix.
- PYTHON-220: Documentation fix.
- PYTHON-219: KeyError in :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_and_modify`
- PYTHON-213: Query server for maximum BSON document size.
- PYTHON-208: Fix :class:`~pymongo.connection.Connection` __repr__.
- PYTHON-207: Changes to Map/Reduce API.
- PYTHON-205: Accept slaveOk in the URI to match the URI docs.
- PYTHON-203: When slave_okay=True and we only specify one host don't autodetect other set members.
- PYTHON-194: Show size when whining about a document being too large.
- PYTHON-184: Raise :class:`~pymongo.errors.DuplicateKeyError` for duplicate keys in capped collections.
- PYTHON-178: Don't segfault when trying to encode a recursive data structure.
- PYTHON-177: Don't segfault when decoding dicts with broken iterators.

- PYTHON-167: Duplicate of PYTHON-166.
- PYTHON-166: Fixes a concurrency issue.
- PYTHON-158: Add code and err string to `db assertion` messages.

Changes in Version 1.9
----------------------

Version 1.9 adds a new package to the PyMongo distribution,
:mod:`bson`. :mod:`bson` contains all of the `BSON
<http://bsonspec.org>`_ encoding and decoding logic, and the BSON
types that were formerly in the :mod:`pymongo` package. The following
modules have been renamed:

  - :mod:`pymongo.bson` -> :mod:`bson`
  - :mod:`pymongo._cbson` -> :mod:`bson._cbson` and
    :mod:`pymongo._cmessage`
  - :mod:`pymongo.binary` -> :mod:`bson.binary`
  - :mod:`pymongo.code` -> :mod:`bson.code`
  - :mod:`pymongo.dbref` -> :mod:`bson.dbref`
  - :mod:`pymongo.json_util` -> :mod:`bson.json_util`
  - :mod:`pymongo.max_key` -> :mod:`bson.max_key`
  - :mod:`pymongo.min_key` -> :mod:`bson.min_key`
  - :mod:`pymongo.objectid` -> :mod:`bson.objectid`
  - :mod:`pymongo.son` -> :mod:`bson.son`
  - :mod:`pymongo.timestamp` -> :mod:`bson.timestamp`
  - :mod:`pymongo.tz_util` -> :mod:`bson.tz_util`

In addition, the following exception classes have been renamed:

  - :class:`pymongo.errors.InvalidBSON` ->
    :class:`bson.errors.InvalidBSON`
  - :class:`pymongo.errors.InvalidStringData` ->
    :class:`bson.errors.InvalidStringData`
  - :class:`pymongo.errors.InvalidDocument` ->
    :class:`bson.errors.InvalidDocument`
  - :class:`pymongo.errors.InvalidId` ->
    :class:`bson.errors.InvalidId`

The above exceptions now inherit from :class:`bson.errors.BSONError`
rather than :class:`pymongo.errors.PyMongoError`.

.. note::  All of the renamed modules and exceptions above have aliases
           created with the old names, so these changes should not break
           existing code. The old names will eventually be deprecated and then
           removed, so users should begin migrating towards the new names now.

.. warning::

  The change to the exception hierarchy mentioned above is
  possibly breaking. If your code is catching
  :class:`~pymongo.errors.PyMongoError`, then the exceptions raised
  by :mod:`bson` will not be caught, even though they would have been
  caught previously. Before upgrading, it is recommended that users
  check for any cases like this.

- the C extension now shares buffer.c/h with the Ruby driver
- :mod:`bson` no longer raises :class:`~pymongo.errors.InvalidName`,
  all occurrences have been replaced with
  :class:`~bson.errors.InvalidDocument`.
- renamed :meth:`bson._to_dicts` to :meth:`~bson.decode_all`.
- renamed :meth:`~bson.BSON.from_dict` to :meth:`~bson.BSON.encode`
  and :meth:`~bson.BSON.to_dict` to :meth:`~bson.BSON.decode`.
- added :meth:`~pymongo.cursor.Cursor.batch_size`.
- allow updating (some) file metadata after a
  :class:`~gridfs.grid_file.GridIn` instance has been closed.
- performance improvements for reading from GridFS.
- special cased slice with the same start and stop to return an empty
  cursor.
- allow writing :class:`unicode` to GridFS if an :attr:`encoding`
  attribute has been specified for the file.
- added :meth:`gridfs.GridFS.get_version`.
- scope variables for :class:`~bson.code.Code` can now be specified as
  keyword arguments.
- added :meth:`~gridfs.grid_file.GridOut.readline` to
  :class:`~gridfs.grid_file.GridOut`.
- make a best effort to transparently auto-reconnect if a
  :class:`~pymongo.connection.Connection` has been idle for a while.
- added :meth:`~pymongo.database.SystemJS.list` to
  :class:`~pymongo.database.SystemJS`.
- added `file_document` argument to :meth:`~gridfs.grid_file.GridOut`
  to allow initializing from an existing file document.
- raise :class:`~pymongo.errors.TimeoutError` even if the
  ``getLastError`` command was run manually and not through "safe"
  mode.
- added :class:`uuid` support to :mod:`~bson.json_util`.

Changes in Version 1.8.1
------------------------

- fixed a typo in the C extension that could cause safe-mode
  operations to report a failure (:class:`SystemError`) even when none
  occurred.
- added a :meth:`__ne__` implementation to any class where we define
  :meth:`__eq__`.

Changes in Version 1.8
----------------------

Version 1.8 adds support for connecting to replica sets, specifying
per-operation values for `w` and `wtimeout`, and decoding to
timezone-aware datetimes.

- fixed a reference leak in the C extension when decoding a
  :class:`~bson.dbref.DBRef`.
- added support for `w`, `wtimeout`, and `fsync` (and any other
  options for `getLastError`) to "safe mode" operations.
- added :attr:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.nodes` property.
- added a maximum pool size of 10 sockets.
- added support for replica sets.
- DEPRECATED :meth:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.from_uri` and
  :meth:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.paired`, both are supplanted
  by extended functionality in :meth:`~pymongo.connection.Connection`.
- added tz aware support for datetimes in
  :class:`~bson.objectid.ObjectId`,
  :class:`~bson.timestamp.Timestamp` and :mod:`~bson.json_util`
  methods.
- added :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.drop` helper.
- reuse the socket used for finding the master when a
  :class:`~pymongo.connection.Connection` is first created.
- added support for :class:`~bson.min_key.MinKey`,
  :class:`~bson.max_key.MaxKey` and
  :class:`~bson.timestamp.Timestamp` to :mod:`~bson.json_util`.
- added support for decoding datetimes as aware (UTC) - it is highly
  recommended to enable this by setting the `tz_aware` parameter to
  :meth:`~pymongo.connection.Connection` to ``True``.
- added `network_timeout` option for individual calls to
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find` and
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one`.
- added :meth:`~gridfs.GridFS.exists` to check if a file exists in
  GridFS.
- added support for additional keys in :class:`~bson.dbref.DBRef`
  instances.

  :class:`~pymongo.errors.OperationFailure` exceptions.
- fixed serialization of int and float subclasses in the C extension.

Changes in Version 1.7
----------------------

Version 1.7 is a recommended upgrade for all PyMongo users. The full
release notes are below, and some more in depth discussion of the
highlights is `here
<http://dirolf.com/2010/06/17/pymongo-1.7-released.html>`_.

- no longer attempt to build the C extension on big-endian systems.
- added :class:`~bson.min_key.MinKey` and
  :class:`~bson.max_key.MaxKey`.
- use unsigned for :class:`~bson.timestamp.Timestamp` in BSON
  encoder/decoder.
- support ``True`` as ``"ok"`` in command responses, in addition to
  ``1.0`` - necessary for server versions **>= 1.5.X**
- BREAKING change to
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.index_information` to add
  support for querying unique status and other index information.
- added :attr:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.document_class`, to
  specify class for returned documents.
- added `as_class` argument for
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find`, and in the BSON decoder.
- added support for creating :class:`~bson.timestamp.Timestamp`
  instances using a :class:`~datetime.datetime`.
- allow `dropTarget` argument for
  :class:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.rename`.
- handle aware :class:`~datetime.datetime` instances, by converting to
  UTC.
- added support for :class:`~pymongo.cursor.Cursor.max_scan`.
- raise :class:`~gridfs.errors.FileExists` exception when creating a
  duplicate GridFS file.
- use `y2038 <http://code.google.com/p/y2038/>`_ for time handling in
  the C extension - eliminates 2038 problems when extension is
  installed.
- added `sort` parameter to
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find`
- finalized deprecation of changes from versions **<= 1.4**
- take any non-:class:`dict` as an ``"_id"`` query for
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find_one` or
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.remove`
- added ability to pass a :class:`dict` for `fields` argument to
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.find` (supports ``"$slice"``
  and field negation)
- simplified code to find master, since paired setups don't always have
  a remote
- fixed bug in C encoder for certain invalid types (like
  :class:`~pymongo.collection.Collection` instances).
- don't transparently map ``"filename"`` key to :attr:`name` attribute
  for GridFS.

Changes in Version 1.6
----------------------

The biggest change in version 1.6 is a complete re-implementation of
:mod:`gridfs` with a lot of improvements over the old
implementation. There are many details and examples of using the new
API in `this blog post
<http://dirolf.com/2010/03/29/new-gridfs-implementation-for-pymongo.html>`_. The
old API has been removed in this version, so existing code will need
to be modified before upgrading to 1.6.

- fixed issue where connection pool was being shared across
  :class:`~pymongo.connection.Connection` instances.
- more improvements to Python code caching in C extension - should
  improve behavior on mod_wsgi.
- added :meth:`~bson.objectid.ObjectId.from_datetime`.
- complete rewrite of :mod:`gridfs` support.
- improvements to the :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.command` API.
- fixed :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.drop_indexes` behavior
  on non-existent collections.
- disallow empty bulk inserts.

Changes in Version 1.5.2
------------------------
- fixed response handling to ignore unknown response flags in queries.
- handle server versions containing '-pre-'.

Changes in Version 1.5.1
------------------------
- added :data:`~gridfs.grid_file.GridFile._id` property for
  :class:`~gridfs.grid_file.GridFile` instances.
- fix for making a :class:`~pymongo.connection.Connection` (with
  `slave_okay` set) directly to a slave in a replica pair.
- accept kwargs for
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.create_index` and
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.ensure_index` to support all
  indexing options.
- add :data:`pymongo.GEO2D` and support for geo indexing.
- improvements to Python code caching in C extension - should improve
  behavior on mod_wsgi.

Changes in Version 1.5
----------------------
- added subtype constants to :mod:`~bson.binary` module.
- DEPRECATED `options` argument to
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection` and
  :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.create_collection` in favor of
  kwargs.
- added :meth:`~pymongo.has_c` to check for C extension.
- added :meth:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.copy_database`.
- added :data:`~pymongo.cursor.Cursor.alive` to tell when a cursor
  might have more data to return (useful for tailable cursors).
- added :class:`~bson.timestamp.Timestamp` to better support
  dealing with internal MongoDB timestamps.
- added `name` argument for
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.create_index` and
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.ensure_index`.
- fixed connection pooling w/ fork
- :meth:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.paired` takes all kwargs that
  are allowed for :meth:`~pymongo.connection.Connection`.
- :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.insert` returns list for bulk
  inserts of size one.
- fixed handling of :class:`datetime.datetime` instances in
  :mod:`~bson.json_util`.
- added :meth:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.from_uri` to support
  MongoDB connection uri scheme.
- fixed chunk number calculation when unaligned in :mod:`gridfs`.
- :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.command` takes a string for simple
  commands.
- added :data:`~pymongo.database.Database.system_js` helper for
  dealing with server-side JS.
- don't wrap queries containing ``"$query"`` (support manual use of
  ``"$min"``, etc.).
- added :class:`~gridfs.errors.GridFSError` as base class for
  :mod:`gridfs` exceptions.

Changes in Version 1.4
----------------------

Perhaps the most important change in version 1.4 is that we have
decided to **no longer support Python 2.3**. The most immediate reason
for this is to allow some improvements to connection pooling. This
will also allow us to use some new (as in Python 2.4 ;) idioms and
will help begin the path towards supporting Python 3.0. If you need to
use Python 2.3 you should consider using version 1.3 of this driver,
although that will no longer be actively supported.

Other changes:

- move ``"_id"`` to front only for top-level documents (fixes some
  corner cases).
- :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.update` and
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.remove` return the entire
  response to the *lastError* command when safe is ``True``.
- completed removal of things that were deprecated in version 1.2 or
  earlier.
- enforce that collection names do not contain the NULL byte.
- fix to allow using UTF-8 collection names with the C extension.
- added :class:`~pymongo.errors.PyMongoError` as base exception class
  for all :mod:`~pymongo.errors`. this changes the exception hierarchy
  somewhat, and is a BREAKING change if you depend on
  :class:`~pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure` being a :class:`IOError`
  or :class:`~bson.errors.InvalidBSON` being a :class:`ValueError`,
  for example.
- added :class:`~pymongo.errors.DuplicateKeyError` for calls to
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.insert` or
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.update` with `safe` set to
  ``True``.
- removed :mod:`~pymongo.thread_util`.
- added :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.add_user` and
  :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.remove_user` helpers.
- fix for :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.authenticate` when using
  non-UTF-8 names or passwords.
- minor fixes for
  :class:`~pymongo.master_slave_connection.MasterSlaveConnection`.
- clean up all cases where :class:`~pymongo.errors.ConnectionFailure`
  is raised.
- simplification of connection pooling - makes driver ~2x faster for
  simple benchmarks. see :ref:`connection-pooling` for more information.
- DEPRECATED `pool_size`, `auto_start_request` and `timeout`
  parameters to :class:`~pymongo.connection.Connection`. DEPRECATED
  :meth:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.start_request`.
- use :meth:`socket.sendall`.
- removed :meth:`~bson.son.SON.from_xml` as it was only being used
  for some internal testing - also eliminates dependency on
  :mod:`elementtree`.
- implementation of :meth:`~pymongo.message.update` in C.
- deprecate :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database._command` in favor of
  :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.command`.
- send all commands without wrapping as ``{"query": ...}``.
- support string as `key` argument to
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.group` (keyf) and run all
  groups as commands.
- support for equality testing for :class:`~bson.code.Code`
  instances.
- allow the NULL byte in strings and disallow it in key names or regex
  patterns

Changes in Version 1.3
----------------------
- DEPRECATED running :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.group` as
  :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.eval`, also changed default for
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.group` to running as a command
- remove :meth:`pymongo.cursor.Cursor.__len__`, which was deprecated
  in 1.1.1 - needed to do this aggressively due to it's presence
  breaking **Django** template *for* loops
- DEPRECATED :meth:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.host`,
  :meth:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.port`,
  :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.connection`,
  :meth:`~pymongo.database.Database.name`,
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.database`,
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.name` and
  :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.full_name` in favor of
  :attr:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.host`,
  :attr:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.port`,
  :attr:`~pymongo.database.Database.connection`,
  :attr:`~pymongo.database.Database.name`,
  :attr:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.database`,
  :attr:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.name` and
  :attr:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.full_name`, respectively. The
  deprecation schedule for this change will probably be faster than
  usual, as it carries some performance implications.
- added :meth:`~pymongo.connection.Connection.disconnect`

Changes in Version 1.2.1
------------------------

  get around some issues with queries on fields named ``query``
- enforce 4MB document limit on the client side
- added :meth:`~pymongo.collection.Collection.map_reduce` helper - see
  :doc:`example <examples/aggregation>`
- added :meth:`~pymongo.cursor.Cursor.distinct` method on
  :class:`~pymongo.cursor.Cursor` instances to allow distinct with
  queries
- fix for :meth:`~pymongo.cursor.Cursor.__getitem__` after
  :meth:`~pymongo.cursor.Cursor.skip`
- allow any UTF-8 string in :class:`~bson.BSON` encoder, not
  just ASCII subset
- added :attr:`~bson.objectid.ObjectId.generation_time`
- removed support for legacy :class:`~bson.objectid.ObjectId`
  format - pretty sure this was never used, and is just confusing

  :meth:`~bson.objectid.ObjectId.url_decode` in favor of :meth:`str`
  and :meth:`~bson.objectid.ObjectId`, respectively
