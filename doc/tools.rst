Tools
=====
Many tools have been written for working with **PyMongo**. If you know
of or have created a tool for working with MongoDB from Python please
list it here.

.. note:: We try to keep this list current. As such, projects that
   have not been updated recently or appear to be unmaintained will
   occasionally be removed from the list or moved to the back (to keep
   the list from becoming too intimidating). If a project gets removed
   that is still being developed or is in active use please let us
   know or add it back.

ORM-like Layers
---------------
Some people have found that they prefer to work with a layer that
has more features than PyMongo provides. Often, things like models and
validation are desired. To that end, several different ORM-like layers
have been written by various authors.

It is our recommendation that new users begin by working directly with
PyMongo, as described in the rest of this documentation. Many people
have found that the features of PyMongo are enough for their
needs. Even if you eventually come to the decision to use one of these
layers, the time spent working directly with the driver will have
increased your understanding of how MongoDB actually works.

Django
  The `Django <http://github.com/FlaPer87/django/>`_ fork
  adds nosql support to Django and implements a mongodb backend 
  that handles mongodb databases. There are 2 repos being used
  for this fork, the one in the first link and this `Django <http://github.com/aparo/django>`_.
  Both repositories are synchronized and have the same code.

MongoKit
  The `MongoKit <http://bitbucket.org/namlook/mongokit/>`_ framework
  is an ORM-like layer on top of PyMongo. There is also a MongoKit
  `google group <http://groups.google.com/group/mongokit>`_.

Ming
  `Ming <http://merciless.sourceforge.net/>`_ (the Merciless) is a
  library that allows you to enforce schemas on a MongoDB database in
  your Python application. It was developed by `SourceForge
  <http://sourceforge.net/>`_ in the course of their migration to
  MongoDB. See the `introductory blog post
  <http://blog.pythonisito.com/2009/12/ming-01-released-python-library-for.html>`_
  for more details.

MongoEngine
  `MongoEngine <http://hmarr.com/mongoengine/>`_ is another ORM-like
  layer on top of PyMongo. It allows you to define schemas for
  documents and query collections using syntax inspired by the Django
  ORM. The code is available on `github
  <http://github.com/hmarr/mongoengine>`_; for more information, see
  the `tutorial <http://hmarr.com/mongoengine/tutorial.html>`_.

pymongo-bongo
  `pymongo-bongo <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo-bongo/>`_ is a
  project to add some syntactic sugar on top of PyMongo. It is open
  source and the code is available on `github
  <http://github.com/svetlyak40wt/pymongo-bongo>`_.

Smaller or less well-maintained projects (in order from most to least
recently committed to at the time of the last update to this list):

  - `mongodb-object <http://github.com/marcboeker/mongodb-object>`_
  - `mongo-mapper <http://github.com/jeffjenkins/mongo-mapper/tree/master>`_
  - `MongoMagic <http://bitbucket.org/bottiger/mongomagic/wiki/Home>`_
  - `django-mongodb <http://bitbucket.org/kpot/django-mongodb/>`_

Framework Tools
---------------
This section lists tools and adapters that have been designed to work with various Python frameworks and libraries.

mango
  `mango <http://github.com/vpulim/mango>`_ provides MongoDB
  backends for Django sessions and authentication (bypassing
  :mod:`django.db` entirely).

mongodb_beaker
  `mongodb_beaker <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mongodb_beaker>`_ is a
  project to enable using MongoDB as a backend for `beaker's
  <http://beaker.groovie.org/>`_ caching / session system. The
  `source is on bitbucket
  <http://bitbucket.org/bwmcadams/mongodb_beaker/>`_.

MongoLog
  `MongoLog <http://github.com/andreisavu/mongodb-log/>`_
  is a Python logging handler that stores logs in MongoDB using a
  capped collection.

c5t
  `c5t <http://bitbucket.org/percious/c5t/>`_ is a
  content-management system using TurboGears and MongoDB.

rod.recipe.mongodb
  `rod.recipe.mongodb
  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/rod.recipe.mongodb/>`_ is a ZC Buildout
  recipe for downloading and installing MongoDB.

repoze-what-plugins-mongodb
  `repoze-what-plugins-mongodb
  <http://code.google.com/p/repoze-what-plugins-mongodb/>`_ is a
  project working to support a plugin for using MongoDB as a backend
  for :mod:`repoze.what`.

Alternative Drivers
-------------------
These are alternatives to PyMongo.

PyMonga
  `PyMonga <http://github.com/fiorix/mongo-async-python-driver>`_ is
  an asynchronous Python driver for MongoDB, although it is not
  currently recommended for production use.
