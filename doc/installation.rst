Installing / Upgrading
======================
.. highlight:: bash

**PyMongo** is in the `Python Package Index
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo/>`_.

Installing with pip
-------------------

We recommend using `pip <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip>`_
to install pymongo::

  $ pip install pymongo

To get a specific version of pymongo::

  $ pip install pymongo==1.10.1

To upgrade using pip::

  $ pip install --upgrade pymongo

Installing with easy_install
----------------------------

If you must install pymongo using
`setuptools <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_ do::

  $ easy_install pymongo

To upgrade do::

  $ easy_install -U pymongo

Mac OS Issues
-------------

By default OSX uses `/usr/bin/easy_install` for third party package installs.
This script is hardcoded to use a version of setuptools that is older than
the version required by pymongo for python2.7 support. You can work around
it like this::

  $ easy_install -U setuptools
  $ python -m easy_install pymongo

To upgrade do::

  $ python -m easy_install -U pymongo

**Xcode 4 Users**: The Python versions shipped with OSX 10.6.x are universal
binaries. They support i386, PPC, and (in the case of python2.6) x86_64.
Xcode 4 removed support for PPC. Because of this the distutils version
shipped with Apple's builds of Python will fail to build the C extensions
if you have Xcode 4 installed. This issue may also affect some builds of
Python downloaded from python.org. There is a workaround::

  # For Apple-supplied Python2.6 (installed at /usr/bin/python2.6)
  $ env ARCHFLAGS='-arch i386 -arch x86_64' python -m easy_install pymongo

  # For 32-bit-only Python (/usr/bin/python2.5 and some builds
  # from python.org)
  $ env ARCHFLAGS='-arch i386' python -m easy_install pymongo

See `http://bugs.python.org/issue11623 <http://bugs.python.org/issue11623>`_
for a more detailed explanation.

Install from source
-------------------

If you'd rather install directly from the source (i.e. to stay on the
bleeding edge), check out the latest source from github and install
the driver from the resulting tree::

  $ git clone git://github.com/mongodb/mongo-python-driver.git pymongo
  $ cd pymongo/
  $ python setup.py install

Dependencies for installing C Extensions on Unix
------------------------------------------------

10gen does not currently provide statically linked binary packages for
Unix flavors other than OSX. To build the optional C extensions you must
have the GNU C compiler (gcc) installed. Depending on your flavor of Unix
(or Linux distribution) you may also need a python development package that
provides the necessary header files for your version of Python. The package
name may vary from distro to distro. Here are some examples for popular
Linux distributions:

- RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux)/CentOS: python-devel
- Debian/Ubuntu: python-dev

Pre-built eggs are available for OSX Snow Leopard on PyPI.

Installing Without C Extensions
-------------------------------
By default, the driver attempts to build and install optional C
extensions (used for increasing performance) when it is installed. If
any extension fails to build the driver will be installed anyway but a
warning will be printed.

In :ref:`certain cases <using-with-mod-wsgi>`, you might wish to
install the driver without the C extensions, even if the extensions
build properly. This can be done using a command line option to
*setup.py*::

  $ python setup.py --no_ext install
